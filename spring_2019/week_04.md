## Last Week's Accomplishments

> We decided to separate into different subgroups and do severl branches in parallel. One group continue figuring out how to install and use AGENCY, one design the UI/UX, and one group design a new program from scratch. I chose the third subgroup and decided our first step, which is Data modeling, and first design the Person / Record Search.

## This Week's Plan

> Our subgroup discussed about the what data model to use and how to design in MySQL and Php. We drew the model table according to the excel APL provide us.


## Anything Blocking?

> Some part of the excel is not clear enough for us, so we need to ask APL for more information and clearfication on it.
