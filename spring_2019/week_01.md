## Last Week's Accomplishments

> The past week, I learned the basic syntax of php and how it works with html.

## This Week's Plan

> After learning php, I plan to install AGENCY app and figure out how it works by manipulating it and reading the code


## Anything Blocking?

> It turns out that installation is based on Postgres database, while I have no experience in database, and I cannot continue the process because I don't know what the error means
