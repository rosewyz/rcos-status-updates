## Last Week's Accomplishments

> The past week, I stilled learned PHP and trying to understand the code in AGENCY. Changed a little bit code in the database, but still gets error message.

## This Week's Plan

> We discussed the possibilities to start from scratch for APL instead of using AGENCY. We are planning to study database, and try to have the data model for the "NEW Project"


## Anything Blocking?

> Know nothing about database, learn from scratch
