## Last Week's Accomplishments

> During the Spring break, our subgroup successfully set up the data model and build the database for the APL using MySQL.

## This Week's Plan

> We decide to implement basic search engine for database using php. The search criteria we decided to be one or more of the following: client name, age, incident reporter (branch) and keyword searching (key word in the description of incidents)


## Anything Blocking?

> We spent a long time learning syntax of MySQL syntax and figuring out the data model. Also, some of the unclearification in the excel APL provided also block us a little bit.
