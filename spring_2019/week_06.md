## Last Week's Accomplishments

> We implemented the basic search engine for a specific client with first name and last name as key and age as a plus search key.

## This Week's Plan

> We decide to implement input function by inputting a person's name and age into Client database. In that case, our system can handle functionality of searching and inputting people.


## Anything Blocking?

> None.
