## Last Week's Accomplishments

> The past week, I stilled learned PHP and trying to install AGENCY on my computer

## This Week's Plan

> Ask other team members if they have done installing and try to install it successfully this week
> Read the updated detailed requirements provided by APL and trying to figure out what can be done


## Anything Blocking?

> The Postgres is still blocking the installation. I got some syntax error, but with no knowledge on database, I do not know if it is caused by the "code" or my too updated Postgres version
